# TCP/UDP communication demo project for RTS

## Fetching
Download the parent repository through web ui, or clone via command line: "git clone https://github.com/tipeJ/JavaProjectRTS"
The project is located in the "laboratoryproject" subfolder, the folder of this README file

## Running

### UDPClient
On command line, run "java UDPclient.java <URL> <PORT>" with the proper URL and PORT arguments for the server

### UDPServer
On command line, run "java UDPServer.java <PORT>

### TCPClient
On command line, run "java TCPClient.java <URL> <PORT> with the wanted server URL and port

### TCPServer
On command line, run "java TCPServer.java". You can specify port with a port parameter i.e. "java TCPServer.java 9090", the default port is 8080

### TCPMultiServer
On command line, run "java TCPMultiServer.java". You can specify port with a port parameter i.e. "java TCPMultiServer.java 9090", the default port is 8080


## Testing
The tests are located in the src/test/java/fr/ensea/rts folder

### Running the tests
Tests have been run on the vscode UI, there is currently no single script that runs all tests on the command line.

Note that unfinished tests may leave processes hanging and prevent testing. To prevent this, either reboot or manually shut down the test processes.


## Javadoc
Javadoc can be generated by running the following command for either (or both) package tcp/udp:
javadoc -d [OUTPUT_FOLDER] *.java

### Getting the latest javadoc from git
Because javadoc constains static resources (such as images), it's stored in GIT LFS (large file storage). To fetch, run "git lfs pull" in the root folder of the project. (laboratoryproject)
